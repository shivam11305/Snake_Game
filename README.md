# Snake_Game
Build a basic snake game using c++.
here we are making snake game that will work by the buttons: W, A, S, D  and here :
W : forward
A : left
S : down
D : right
the game is based on the infinite loop till the user wants to play the game will run (by pressing Y button each time to continue) 
as user presses other keys the wile loop ends and execution stops.
